# Introduction history of grain amaranth to India
Global climate change will impact worldwide crop yields, requiring shifts and adaptation of crop varieties. The recent global spread of crops across different continents represents an extreme case of expansion, serving as a model to study the factors and sources enabling adaptation to rapidly changing environments. One such spread is the introduction of the nutritious pseudocereal amaranth to India. Grain amaranth has been domesticated over 6,000 years ago in three different regions of the Americas and was only introduced to India approximately 500 years ago. Nowadays numerous local landraces grow throughout the country’s wide climatic conditions. We investigate the introduction of grain amaranth to India to understand the factors allowing successful establishment of crops to novel environments, using whole genome sequencing of about 190 accessions from India and more than 100 from the crop’s native distribution. Our results suggest that introduced crops can act as reservoirs of acquired diversity, providing additional adaptive potential and resilience to future environmental change.
